# AI Snake Game

AI Snake Game is an AI that has been trained to play snake.

## Summary of the Project
The project was based on the AI made by python-engineer. He gives an in depth tutorial on how he designed it. We divided the project by breaking it down into tasks then group members worked on their part. This was a good project to work on for people who have little to no background but want to build something. It let us dip our feet in Machine Learning and something to talk about when we met up. In our meetings we talked about what we did, what to do, and how it works. The end results were that some people worked on taks and others finished the whole thing. Either way everyone who participated learned
